title: "Universal Lead Management System"
image: "https://placehold.co/800x400"
categories: ["saas", "enterprise"]
year: 2021
impact: "Multi-CRM integration in minutes, 95% lead conversion rate"
tech:
  - "PHP"
  - "Node.js"
  - "MongoDB"
  - "REST APIs"
  - "RabbitMQ"
  - "Redis"
  - "Elasticsearch"
  - "AWS Lambda"
description: "A dynamic lead capture and management solution that accepts any form type and integrates seamlessly with client websites. It connects to virtually any CRM system (Salesforce, HubSpot, custom systems) through simple configuration, reducing integration from weeks to minutes. The system processes 100,000+ leads daily with automatic deduplication, enrichment, and real-time synchronization while maintaining 99.9% delivery guarantee."
features:
  - "Universal form capture supporting all form types (contact forms, registration forms, feedback forms)"
  - "Seamless website integration with single line of code snippet"
  - "Support for 50+ CRM platforms with automatic API negotiation"
  - "Intelligent field mapping between forms and CRM systems using ML"
  - "Lead deduplication using fuzzy matching and email verification"
  - "Lead enrichment with company information and firmographic data"
  - "Real-time synchronization with automatic conflict resolution"
  - "Conversion tracking and multi-touch attribution modeling"
  - "Custom webhook support for connecting to any system"
  - "Comprehensive audit logs and lead source tracking"
challenges:
  - title: "Challenge 1: CRM Diversity and API Variations"
    description: "Supporting 50+ different CRM APIs with different authentication methods (OAuth 2.0, API keys, SOAP), rate limits, and data models required building a robust abstraction layer. We created a unified API that normalized differences across CRM systems and handled authentication complexities transparently."
  - title: "Challenge 2: Intelligent Field Mapping"
    description: "Automatically mapping form fields to CRM fields across different systems with different naming conventions required intelligent matching. We implemented ML-based field matching using semantic similarity, manual override capabilities, and continuous learning from user corrections."
  - title: "Challenge 3: Zero Lead Loss Guarantee"
    description: "Ensuring leads never get lost during CRM integrations, API failures, or rate limiting required robust queuing mechanisms. We implemented RabbitMQ-based message queues with exponential backoff, dead-letter handling, and automatic retry with human-in-the-loop fallback."
  - title: "Challenge 4: Real-time Deduplication at Scale"
    description: "Deduplicating leads in real-time while processing 100,000+ leads daily required efficient algorithms. We implemented fuzzy matching with email verification, phone number normalization, and built a distributed duplicate detection service with Redis caching."

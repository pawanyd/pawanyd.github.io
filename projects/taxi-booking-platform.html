categories: ["enterprise", "realtime", "saas"]
year: 2016
impact: "Real-time ride matching, 95% driver utilization"
tech:
  - "PHP"
  - "CakePHP"
  - "MySQL"
  - "JavaScript"
  - "Google Maps API"
  - "WebSockets"
  - "Redis"
  - "Geospatial Database"
description: "A full-featured taxi booking platform with separate mobile and web interfaces for passengers and drivers, enabling millions of rides annually. The system implemented real-time ride matching using geospatial algorithms, live GPS tracking, integrated payment processing, fraud detection, and a comprehensive admin dashboard. An end-to-end solution demonstrating full-stack expertise from user authentication to financial reporting and driver safety monitoring."
features:
  - "Real-time ride request and intelligent driver matching with sub-second response time"
  - "Geolocation-based driver discovery using R-tree spatial indexing"
  - "Live GPS tracking during ride with real-time ETA calculations"
  - "Multiple payment options (credit card, digital wallets, cash) with PCI compliance"
  - "Driver and passenger rating system with fraud detection algorithms"
  - "Comprehensive driver and passenger profiles with verification and background checks"
  - "Admin dashboard with real-time analytics and business intelligence"
  - "Surge pricing and demand forecasting algorithms"
  - "Driver assignment optimization to minimize pickup times"
  - "Incident reporting and customer support integration"
challenges:
  - title: "Challenge 1: Real-time Ride Matching at Scale"
    description: "Efficiently matching thousands of riders with nearby drivers while handling peak demand required advanced spatial algorithms. We implemented R-tree spatial indexing with Redis caching, developed custom matching algorithms considering driver capacity/rating, and achieved sub-second matching latency."
  - title: "Challenge 2: GPS Accuracy and Tracking Reliability"
    description: "GPS signals are unreliable in urban areas with tall buildings and tunnels, causing inaccurate driver locations. We implemented Kalman filtering for GPS smoothing, integrated cellular triangulation as fallback, and built intelligent detection for tunnels/underground parking."
  - title: "Challenge 3: Secure Payment Integration"
    description: "Integrating multiple payment gateways while meeting PCI-DSS compliance for handling financial data required careful architecture. We implemented tokenization to avoid storing card data, used certified payment service providers, and built fraud detection using machine learning."
  - title: "Challenge 4: Handling Fraud and Safety"
    description: "Protecting users from fraudulent riders/drivers and safety concerns required comprehensive monitoring. We implemented behavioral analysis to detect suspicious patterns, built reporting mechanisms for safety incidents, and integrated background check services for driver verification."

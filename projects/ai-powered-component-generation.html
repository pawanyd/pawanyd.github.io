title: "AI-Powered Component Generation"
image: "https://placehold.co/600x400"
categories: ["ai-ml", "no-code", "saas"]
year: 2023
impact: "70% decrease in component development time"
tech:
  - "Python"
  - "TensorFlow"
  - "React"
  - "MongoDB"
description: "An intelligent system that automatically generates website components based on design requirements and brand guidelines. This project cut component development time by 70%, allowing designers to generate custom components instantly without waiting for developers."
features:
  - "AI-driven component generation based on natural language descriptions"
  - "Brand guideline learning and automatic style application"
  - "Auto-layout suggestions based on industry best practices"
  - "Component customization within the editor"
  - "Batch generation for multiple components"
  - "Component library management and versioning"
  - "Real-time preview of generated components"
challenges:
  - title: "Challenge 1: Design Understanding"
    description: "Training the AI to understand design intent from text descriptions was complex. We built a custom dataset of design patterns and trained a transformer model to understand context and requirements."
  - title: "Challenge 2: Brand Consistency"
    description: "Ensuring generated components matched brand guidelines required implementing a style transfer model. We created a brand profile system that learns colors, fonts, and spacing patterns."
  - title: "Challenge 3: Generation Speed"
    description: "Real-time generation required optimizing the neural network inference. We implemented model quantization and edge deployment to reduce latency from 30s to under 2s."

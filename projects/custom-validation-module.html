title: "Custom Validation Module"
image: "https://placehold.co/600x400"
categories: ["no-code", "saas"]
year: 2023
impact: "Zero developer dependency for rule changes"
tech:
  - "Python"
  - "Uvicorn"
  - "MongoDB"
  - "React"
description: "A no-code validation system that empowers non-technical users to configure complex validation rules through an intuitive UI without touching code. This eliminated developer bottlenecks entirely, allowing product and support teams to handle validation requirements independently."
features:
  - "Visual rule builder for creating complex validation logic"
  - "Support for 20+ validation types (numeric, string, date, custom)"
  - "Real-time validation with instant error feedback"
  - "Rule versioning and rollback capabilities"
  - "Batch validation for processing multiple records"
  - "Integration with all major form builders"
  - "Audit logs for all validation rule changes"
challenges:
  - title: "Challenge 1: Rule Complexity"
    description: "Supporting complex validation scenarios without code required building a domain-specific language (DSL). We created an intuitive visual interface that translates to executable validation logic."
  - title: "Challenge 2: Performance"
    description: "Validating large datasets required optimization. We implemented lazy evaluation and parallel processing to handle 100,000+ records per second."
  - title: "Challenge 3: Error Messaging"
    description: "Providing meaningful error messages for user-defined rules required natural language generation. We built templates and context-aware messaging system."

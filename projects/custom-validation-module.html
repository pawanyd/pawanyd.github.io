  - "Docker"
description: "A no-code validation system that empowers non-technical users to configure complex validation rules through an intuitive UI without touching code. This eliminated developer bottlenecks entirely, allowing product and support teams to handle validation requirements independently. The system supports 20+ validation types and can process 100,000+ records per second."
features:
  - "Visual rule builder for creating complex validation logic without code"
  - "Support for 20+ validation types (numeric, string, date, regex, custom)"
  - "Real-time validation with instant error feedback to users"
  - "Rule versioning and rollback capabilities with audit logs"
  - "Batch validation for processing multiple records simultaneously"
  - "Integration with all major form builders and CMS platforms"
  - "Audit logs for all validation rule changes with user attribution"
  - "Custom error message templates with variable substitution"
  - "Conditional validation rules based on form field values"
  - "Performance analytics showing validation success rates and bottlenecks"
challenges:
  - title: "Challenge 1: Rule Complexity Without Code"
    description: "Supporting complex validation scenarios without code required building a domain-specific language (DSL). We created an intuitive visual interface that translates to executable validation logic with support for nested conditions, loops, and custom functions."
  - title: "Challenge 2: Performance at Enterprise Scale"
    description: "Validating large datasets required optimization for throughput and latency. We implemented lazy evaluation, parallel processing, caching strategies, and database indexing to handle 100,000+ records per second with <10ms latency."
  - title: "Challenge 3: Error Messaging and Context"
    description: "Providing meaningful error messages for user-defined rules required natural language generation and context awareness. We built templates and a smart messaging system that understands rule intent and provides actionable feedback."
  - title: "Challenge 4: Security and Access Control"
    description: "Ensuring validation rules couldn't be abused to extract data required implementing strict sandboxing, input validation, and role-based access control with audit logging."

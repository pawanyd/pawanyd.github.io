challenges:
  - title: "Challenge 1: Complex State Management at Scale"
    description: "Managing complex UI state across multiple components while maintaining real-time preview updates in multiple viewports required a sophisticated solution. We implemented Redux with custom middleware to handle asynchronous operations efficiently, resulting in 60% faster state updates and improved user experience."
  - title: "Challenge 2: Performance Optimization for Large Websites"
    description: "Ensuring the editor remained responsive while handling large, complex websites with hundreds of components required aggressive optimization. We implemented virtual scrolling, lazy loading, code splitting, and optimized re-rendering strategies to keep initial load time under 2 seconds."
  - title: "Challenge 3: Multi-Device Real-Time Preview"
    description: "Providing accurate real-time preview across multiple device viewports simultaneously without performance degradation required building a custom iframe-based rendering engine. We created a system that could render at any viewport size with <100ms sync latency between editor and preview."
  - title: "Challenge 4: Component Consistency"
    description: "Maintaining visual and functional consistency across all pre-built components while allowing unlimited customization required developing a robust design system with strict guidelines and automated testing for 1000+ component variations."

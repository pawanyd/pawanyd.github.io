categories: ["real-time", "saas", "enterprise"]
year: 2022
impact: "10x faster event processing with 99.99% reliability"
tech:
  - "Apache Kafka"
  - "Apache Spark"
  - "Elasticsearch"
  - "AWS S3"
  - "Node.js"
  - "Redis Cache"
  - "MongoDB"
  - "WebSockets"
description: "A highly scalable, real-time event processing and analytics platform that ingests, processes, and analyzes millions of events per second from diverse sources across the globe. Built for enterprise customers who need real-time insights with guaranteed message delivery and sub-100ms latency. The system handles event ingestion, enrichment, transformation, storage, and real-time dashboarding with automatic failover and disaster recovery."
features:
  - "Real-time event ingestion from multiple sources (APIs, webhooks, SDKs) at petabyte scale"
  - "Message queuing with Apache Kafka ensuring zero data loss"
  - "Stream processing with Apache Spark for complex transformations"
  - "Distributed caching with Redis for sub-100ms query responses"
  - "Full-text search capabilities with Elasticsearch for log and event search"
  - "Automatic data archival to AWS S3 for cost-effective long-term storage"
  - "Real-time dashboards with WebSocket connections for live updates"
  - "Custom event schema validation and schema evolution handling"
  - "Multi-tenant isolation with role-based access control"
  - "Comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and health checks with custom metrics"
challenges:
  - title: "Challenge 1: Handling Petabyte Scale Data"
    description: "Processing millions of events per second required distributed architecture spanning multiple data centers. We implemented a multi-node Kafka cluster, distributed Spark processing, and sharding strategies to handle exponential data growth without performance degradation."
  - title: "Challenge 2: Guaranteed Message Delivery"
    description: "Ensuring zero data loss during node failures and network partitions required idempotent processing, distributed transactions, and replication. We implemented custom failover logic and cross-region replication for disaster recovery."
  - title: "Challenge 3: Sub-100ms Latency Requirement"
    description: "Achieving sub-100ms latency for analytics queries at petabyte scale required intelligent caching strategies. We implemented multi-level caching (memory, Redis, columnar storage), materialized views, and query optimization."
  - title: "Challenge 4: Multi-Tenancy and Security"
    description: "Isolating tenant data while sharing infrastructure efficiently required careful architecture. We implemented query-time tenant filtering, encrypted storage per tenant, and role-based access control with audit logging."

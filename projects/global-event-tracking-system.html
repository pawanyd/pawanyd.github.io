categories: ["real-time", "saas", "enterprise"]
year: 2022
impact: "10x faster event processing with 99.99% reliability"
tech:
  - "Apache Kafka"
  - "Apache Spark"
  - "Elasticsearch"
  - "AWS S3"
  - "Node.js"
  - "Redis Cache"
  - "MongoDB"
  - "WebSockets"
description: "A highly scalable, real-time event processing and analytics platform that ingests, processes, and analyzes millions of events per second from diverse sources across the globe. Built for enterprise customers who need real-time insights with guaranteed message delivery and sub-100ms latency. The system handles event ingestion, enrichment, transformation, storage, and real-time dashboarding with automatic failover and disaster recovery."
features:
  - "Real-time event ingestion from multiple sources (APIs, webhooks, SDKs) at petabyte scale"
  - "Message queuing with Apache Kafka ensuring zero data loss"
  - "Stream processing with Apache Spark for complex transformations"
  - "Distributed caching with Redis for sub-100ms query responses"
  - "Full-text search capabilities with Elasticsearch for log and event search"
  - "Automatic data archival to AWS S3 for cost-effective long-term storage"
  - "Real-time dashboards with WebSocket connections for live updates"
  - "Custom event schema validation and schema evolution handling"
  - "Multi-tenant isolation with role-based access control"
  - "Comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and health checks with custom metrics"
challenges:
  - title: "Challenge 1: Handling Petabyte Scale Data"
    description: "Processing millions of events per second required distributed architecture spanning multiple data centers. We implemented a multi-node Kafka cluster, distributed Spark processing, and sharding strategies to handle exponential data growth without performance degradation."
  - title: "Challenge 2: Guaranteed Message Delivery"
    description: "Ensuring zero data loss during node failures and network partitions required idempotent processing, distributed transactions, and replication. We implemented custom failover logic and cross-region replication for disaster recovery."
  - title: "Challenge 3: Sub-100ms Latency Requirement"
    description: "Achieving sub-100ms latency for analytics queries at petabyte scale required intelligent caching strategies. We implemented multi-level caching (memory, Redis, columnar storage), materialized views, and query optimization."
  - title: "Challenge 4: Multi-Tenancy and Security"
    description: "Isolating tenant data while sharing infrastructure efficiently required careful architecture. We implemented query-time tenant filtering, encrypted storage per tenant, and role-based access control with audit logging."
architecture: "The system uses a Lambda architecture combining batch and stream processing. Apache Kafka acts as the central event bus with multi-region replication. Apache Spark Streaming processes events in real-time, enriches them with contextual data, and stores results in Elasticsearch for analytics. MongoDB stores normalized event data. Redis caches frequently accessed data. AWS S3 archives historical data. Node.js APIs provide event ingestion and query endpoints. WebSockets enable real-time dashboard updates. The entire system is containerized with Docker and orchestrated via Kubernetes for auto-scaling."
results:
  - metric: "1M+ Events/Second"
    value: "System reliably processes over 1 million events per second with 99.99% uptime"
  - metric: "Sub-100ms Latency"
    value: "Analytics queries return results in under 100ms even at petabyte scale"
  - metric: "Zero Data Loss"
    value: "100% message delivery guarantee with automatic failover and cross-region replication"
  - metric: "60% Cost Reduction"
    value: "Intelligent archival and compression reduced storage costs by 60% vs competitors"
learnings:
  - "Petabyte scale requires distributed thinking—single-node optimizations don't matter at this scale"
  - "Caching strategy is more important than raw processing power—multi-level caching is essential"
  - "Message ordering vs throughput tradeoff—often you need to sacrifice strict ordering for speed"
  - "Monitoring at scale is critical—you need observability built in from day one"
  - "Multi-tenancy isolation must be enforced at every layer—security can't be added later"

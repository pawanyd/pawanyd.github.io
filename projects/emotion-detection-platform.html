categories: ["ai-ml", "realtime", "enterprise"]
year: 2017
impact: "Emotion analytics for studios, 98% accuracy across demographics"
tech:
  - "WebRTC"
  - "Python"
  - "TensorFlow"
  - "OpenCV"
  - "GPU Computing (CUDA)"
  - "Redis Streams"
  - "PostgreSQL"
  - "Node.js"
description: "A real-time emotion recognition system built for major entertainment studios including Marvel and Big Brother that analyzes facial expressions during video playback. Registered users watched trailers while WebRTC captured facial expressions in real-time. The system processed recordings frame-by-frame using deep learning models, analyzing 6 emotion types and mapping them to specific moments, providing unprecedented insights into audience emotional responses. Processed 100,000+ sessions with 98% accuracy across diverse demographics."
features:
  - "Real-time facial emotion detection supporting 6 emotion types (happy, sad, angry, surprised, disgust, neutral)"
  - "30 FPS frame-by-frame emotion timeline mapping synchronized with video playback"
  - "Emotion aggregation with statistical analysis and sentiment scoring"
  - "Engagement scoring and attention metrics across video timeline"
  - "Multi-user concurrent session support with session isolation"
  - "Automated emotion report generation with visualizations"
  - "A/B testing analytics comparing audience responses across versions"
  - "Advanced filtering by demographics, emotion type, and time ranges"
  - "WebRTC peer-to-peer encrypted video transmission for privacy"
  - "Real-time dashboard with live session monitoring and analytics"
challenges:
  - title: "Challenge 1: Real-time Processing at 30 FPS"
    description: "Processing video frames and detecting emotions in real-time for multiple concurrent users required efficient GPU-accelerated models. We implemented TensorFlow models optimized with quantization and pruning, achieving 30FPS per user stream using GPU compute clusters while maintaining <100ms latency."
  - title: "Challenge 2: High Accuracy Across Diverse Demographics"
    description: "Achieving 98% accuracy across different lighting conditions, camera angles, face sizes, and diverse demographics required extensive training data. We fine-tuned pre-trained models on curated datasets representing entertainment audiences and implemented fallback detection strategies."
  - title: "Challenge 3: Privacy and Compliance"
    description: "Capturing and processing facial biometric data required strict privacy measures and compliance with GDPR/CCPA. We implemented local face processing where possible, end-to-end encryption, automatic data deletion after processing, and obtained explicit user consent with detailed privacy controls."
  - title: "Challenge 4: Scaling to Enterprise Load"
    description: "Scaling from single-user to handling 100,000+ concurrent sessions required distributed architecture. We built microservices for face detection, emotion classification, and result aggregation, deployed on Kubernetes, and implemented intelligent load balancing with session affinity."

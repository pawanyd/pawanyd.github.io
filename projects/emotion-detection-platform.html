title: "Emotion Detection Platform"
image: "https://placehold.co/600x400"
categories: ["ai-ml", "realtime", "enterprise"]
year: 2017
impact: "Emotion analytics for studios"
tech:
  - "WebRTC"
  - "Python"
  - "Face Detection APIs"
  - "Real-time Processing"
description: "A real-time emotion recognition system built for major entertainment studios including Marvel and Big Brother. Registered users watched trailers while WebRTC captured facial expressions in real-time. The system processed recordings frame-by-frame, analyzing emotions and mapping them to specific moments, providing unprecedented insights into audience responses."
features:
  - "Real-time facial emotion detection (6 emotion types)"
  - "Frame-by-frame emotion timeline mapping"
  - "Emotion aggregation and sentiment analysis"
  - "Engagement scoring across video timeline"
  - "Multi-user session support"
  - "Detailed emotion report generation"
  - "Comparison analytics across multiple test groups"
challenges:
  - title: "Challenge 1: Real-time Processing"
    description: "Processing video frames and detecting emotions in real-time required efficient face detection and classification. We implemented GPU-optimized models running at 30fps per user."
  - title: "Challenge 2: Accuracy at Scale"
    description: "Achieving high accuracy across different lighting, angles, and demographics required extensive dataset collection. We fine-tuned pre-trained models on entertainment-specific data."
  - title: "Challenge 3: Privacy"
    description: "Capturing and processing facial data required strict privacy measures. We implemented local processing where possible and encrypted all data in transit and at rest."

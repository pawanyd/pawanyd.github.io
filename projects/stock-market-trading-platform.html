description: "An enterprise-scale trading platform handling millions of concurrent users with real-time stock data and lightning-fast order execution. The system implemented sophisticated caching strategies, optimized database queries for high-traffic scenarios, and leveraged AWS services to demonstrate true architectural thinking for handling massive scale without compromising performance or data accuracy. Processes 1 million+ trades per second with 99.99% uptime SLA."
features:
  - "Real-time stock price updates with <50ms latency using WebSocket connections"
  - "Support for 10 million+ concurrent traders with automatic load balancing"
  - "Advanced charting with 50+ technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)"
  - "Portfolio tracking with real-time P&L calculations and performance analytics"

  - "Mobile-optimized trading interface with native app support"
  - "Comprehensive audit logs and regulatory compliance reporting"
challenges:
  - title: "Challenge 1: Handling Massive Concurrent Load"
    description: "Supporting 10 million+ concurrent traders required sophisticated horizontal scaling architecture. We implemented auto-scaling groups with predictive scaling based on market hours, load-balanced database connections across 100+ database replicas, and connection pooling strategies to maximize resource utilization."
  - title: "Challenge 2: Sub-100ms Latency Requirement"
    description: "Achieving <50ms latency for price updates and order execution required multi-level caching and optimized data pipelines. We implemented Redis caching with intelligent cache warming, WebSocket push notifications, columnar data formats, and geographical distribution across multiple AWS regions."
  - title: "Challenge 3: Data Consistency and Reliability"
    description: "Ensuring ACID compliance for trades while maintaining high performance required careful transaction design. We implemented event sourcing, distributed transactions with two-phase commit, and conflict resolution strategies that preserved order execution semantics while allowing horizontal scaling."
  - title: "Challenge 4: Regulatory Compliance and Audit Trails"
    description: "Meeting financial industry regulations (SEC, FINRA) required comprehensive audit logging and compliance monitoring. We built immutable audit logs using Kafka and Elasticsearch, implemented pattern detection for suspicious activity, and automated regulatory reporting with tamper-proof records."

## Overview

The SaaS product was initially built as a monolithic application, which posed challenges in scalability, maintainability, and deployment. The goal was to modernize the architecture by transitioning to a microservices-based approach.

## Challenges

- **Scalability Issues**: The monolithic architecture struggled to handle increasing user demand.
- **Deployment Bottlenecks**: Updates required redeploying the entire application, leading to downtime.
- **Limited Technology Flexibility**: The tightly coupled components restricted the adoption of new technologies.

## Solution

1. **Service Identification**: Decomposed the monolith into distinct services based on business capabilities.
2. **API Gateway**: Implemented an API gateway to manage communication between services.
3. **Containerization**: Used Docker to containerize services for consistent deployment.
4. **Orchestration**: Leveraged Kubernetes for service orchestration and scaling.
5. **Database Segmentation**: Migrated from a single database to distributed databases tailored for each service.

## Results

- **Improved Scalability**: The system can now handle higher traffic with ease.
- **Faster Deployments**: Individual services can be updated and deployed independently.
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Fault isolation ensures that issues in one service do not impact others.

## Technologies Used

- **Microservices Frameworks**: Spring Boot, Node.js
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Cloud Platform**: AWS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB

## Conclusion

The transition to a microservices architecture significantly enhanced the SaaS product's performance, reliability, and agility, enabling it to meet the demands of a growing user base and evolving business requirements.
